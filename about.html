<p>Alright in all seriousness this is a game made for our CISPROG final.

    This game was built on the latest version of Python 3. Everything was done in one file and runs off of
    complex functions with detailed equations that factor in how many customers you get per day.
    However, this variable is prone to error at some times.

    The Entire documentation cannot be put in here so a list of commands plus more information on the program will be embedded below:
 "Commands: Commands in game come in several different forms. These are: Full-Word Commands: Full word commands require you to type the word out exactly as it is presented. An indicator of what to type into the program is: 'Example Input'

Letter-Only Commands: Letter only commands require you to input a single letter. It can be uppercase or lowercase 'A'. Some might come with periods afterwards, those should not be added.

Integer commands: These commands usually come without any indication of limited commands. This will usually appear whenever you are trying to: Set your recipe or setting the timescale the simulation runs at.

Selecting the timescale: When you are prompted with the question: How fast would you like the simulation to run you will be given the option to input any integer you'd like.

The lower the integer, the faster the simulation will run. This is due to the command time.sleep() operating off of a variable that gets the input from the player."
 This game comes in an .exe but the source will be provided on the downloads page.
